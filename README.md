#  Module 20 : Portfolio Page using React

## Overview

I have created a Portfolio website to market my skills, experience, and self. The page has links to previous work, contact details, and a recent headshot.

The page is designed to be responsive and adaptive to different viewports as well as with clickable links both internal and external.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site doesn't currently have a back end to collect info but has a form to be filled out. All toher links are live and lead you to previous work.
