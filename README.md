#  SashDC - WebDev Portfolio

## Overview

I have created a Portfolio website to market my skills, experience, and self. The page has links to previous work, contact details, and a recent headshot.

The page is designed to be responsive and adaptive to different viewports as well as with clickable links both internal and external.
