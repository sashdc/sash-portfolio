              <h1 className="">Hi! I'm Saharsh! (but you can call me Sash)</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a full stack developer with a background in photography,
            advertising, and graphic design. I aim to use my years in the visual
            arts to create webapps that are bold, pleasing to the eye, and a
            joy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 12 years of work in client facing fields all over the
            world, I am well versed in making things that look good, feel good,
            and make my clients happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the 5 minutes a day that I'm not writing code or editing photos,
            I'm probably incurring the wrath of my 2 kids, Zoe & Ozzy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have a look around, see what I've done, and get in touch if you want
            to learn more or work together.
          </p>
          <p>Ta!</p>
